# EpiQu


# •	Innovation

Education is an essential part of our lives. Transforming this vast area is no easy task. There is a demand for something that fills the technical gaps created by online programs. This is where the "Epiqu" app comes into play. We've redesigned a traditional quiz application to make it more like a game. This app is a quiz app disguised as a game, so it arouses children's interest.


# •	Old Education System

We are aware of how education has evolved over time. The traditional and direct teacher-student interaction, in which the instructor teaches and the students learn, was the first type of engagement. This system has existed for a long time, primarily in India.


# •	Online Classes

However, beginning in March 2020, things were set to change. It is, indeed, the well-known pandemic lockdown. Even in such trying times, education continued; it evolved and took on a new form known as online classes. Teachers taught through online meetings, which included the use of technology such as whiteboards and videos, among other things.


# •	Post-Online Classes


We've all returned to our classes, but things don't feel the same. Teaching was exciting in the online form with the use of technology, and our brains just cannot return to way things were. There is a gap following returning to physical engagement. We are unable to adjust since we are accustomed to incorporating technology into our educational system.

This is where we innovate in order to fill that gap in the education system in a fun way. It is obvious that technology must be reintroduced. There are numerous options, but only a few can transform learning into something exciting and challenging for students. Epiqu is more than just a quiz app; it also lets you play games while taking quizzes. We have created a platform that will allow students from all over the world to compete against one another using our quizzes, which will serve as an actual demonstration of their knowledge. Let's look more closely at what this app has to offer.

1) The question now is how to make it competitive. This can be accomplished by utilising multiple game modes. Users can form teams and compete in quizzes in our team    fights. Individual modes can also be accessed. Ranked match mode is in its own league, complete with a sense of status. The higher a user's rank, the more quizzes    they win, and you will always be matched with someone of the same rating. Aside from that, there are regular matches in which you are partnered with random people;    these are not ranked but extremely difficult.

2) The next step is to spice it up and make it more enjoyable. Users can employ the game's characters, however these distinct characters have their own skills that      can be used in quizzes. Cindress is a fire-based character with the ability turboblaze, which allows the user to continue their streak for more than one round.        Then there's Niftry, the ninja with the ability to hyper switch, which means she can exchange one question for another. Petil, the giver of life, comes next. Her      "overgrow" talent gives the player a 35% chance of doubling their score in three rounds. There's also Syrex. He may utilise his ability "brain death" to target         other users, preventing them from using any special powers for two rounds.

3) When it comes to power-ups, these are one-of-a-kind items that assist the user in improving their quiz performance. The first is a blizzard of time. You can use      this item to stop time for ten seconds. Then there's the surge. This one allows you to score twice as many points in 15 seconds. Following that is the sharp eye,      an antique artefact that removes two incorrect options. We've reached the more potent stuff. The iron body is the first of these. This item fortifies you to the      point where you can suffer the consequences if you select the incorrect option and gives you a second chance to answer the same question. Then there's curse, a        fabled spell that shortens the time it takes for any other user's next question. Then there's curse, a legendary spell that cuts the time it takes for any other      user's next query in half. Finally, there is a very unusual spell known as thief. This item is difficult to obtain; it must be earned. This is because it has the      ability to take 500 points from another player.

4) With all of this in place, it is possible to build communities. One of the most significant advantages of being a part of a community is the ability to expand your    network while also exchanging knowledge in a fun way. Our app has the ability to help children grow in a positive way.

5) As in all other games, there is a store to spice things up. Crowns are given to players who win quizzes. These crowns can be spent to buy power-ups, characters,      and game themes at the store.

# •	Conclusion


It would be revolutionary if Epiqu became well-known. Every day, more and more students would come here to play and compete. This would be a fantastic use of technology to not just fill the need left by after-school online programmes, but to take learning to a whole new level.

We may imagine global learning communities, information exchange, and, most importantly, enjoyable learning. This has the potential to become one of the most significant educational phenomena.
